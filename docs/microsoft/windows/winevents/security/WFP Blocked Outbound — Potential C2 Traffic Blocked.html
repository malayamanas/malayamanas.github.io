<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary maintains communication with compromised systems by exploiting T1071. Windows Security Event 5157 (The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked a connection) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker achieves initial access to the target environment through social engineering, exploitation, or use of stolen credentials.</li>
  <li>Using the foothold, the attacker performs command and control activity related to WFP Blocked Outbound — Potential C2 Traffic Blocked, targeting the relevant Windows subsystem or service.</li>
  <li>The attack leverages MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique T1071 to achieve the objective, using tools and techniques common to this attack category.</li>
  <li>Windows Security Event(s) 5157 are generated, capturing critical details of the activity including the actor identity, target object, and operation performed.</li>
  <li>Post-attack, the attacker may perform additional lateral movement, persistence, or data collection based on the access gained.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CobaltStrike (commercial C2 framework)</li>
  <li>Metasploit Framework (open-source exploitation)</li>
  <li>Impacket (Python network protocol library)</li>
  <li>CrackMapExec (post-exploitation framework)</li>
  <li>PowerSploit / PowerView (PowerShell attack modules)</li>
</ul>

<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessID</strong></td><td>Unexpected or anomalous values in this field context</td><td>Provides essential context for understanding the ProcessID involved in this event</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Application</strong></td><td>LSASS.exe, winlogon.exe, or svchost.exe making network connections; any process making connections to unexpected destinations</td><td>The process initiating the network connection; system processes should have limited, predictable network behaviour</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Direction</strong></td><td>Inbound on non-standard ports; outbound from LSASS, svchost, or winlogon to external IPs</td><td>Network connection direction; outbound from credential processes to external hosts indicates exfiltration</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SourceAddress</strong></td><td>External or unauthorized source IPs for management traffic; spoofed source addresses in internal traffic</td><td>Source IP for the connection; links network activity to a specific host for isolation and investigation</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SourcePort</strong></td><td>High-numbered ephemeral ports from persistent long-running connections may indicate C2 keepalive</td><td>Source port; unusual persistence of a specific source port over time indicates a sustained connection</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DestAddress</strong></td><td>Internal Domain Controllers, sensitive servers, or external IPs from unexpected processes (e.g., LSASS making outbound connections)</td><td>Destination IP; LSASS or system processes connecting to external IPs indicate credential exfiltration</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DestPort</strong></td><td>445 (SMB), 389/636 (LDAP), 88 (Kerberos), 3389 (RDP), 5985/5986 (WinRM) from unexpected sources; non-standard ports from system processes</td><td>Destination port reveals the intended protocol; protocol-anomaly detection (e.g., Kerberos from non-DC) is powerful</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Protocol</strong></td><td>Protocol 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP); non-standard protocols (1=ICMP, 47=GRE) from system processes may indicate tunnelling</td><td>Network protocol identifier; protocol anomalies combined with suspicious applications reveal covert channels</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>FilterRTID</strong></td><td>Unexpected or anomalous values in this field context</td><td>Provides essential context for understanding the FilterRTID involved in this event</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (Low Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 5157 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 5157
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 5157 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 5157 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 5157 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate administrative activity during change management windows may generate similar events</li>
  <li>Automated enterprise management platforms (SCCM, Ansible, Puppet) perform similar operations as part of configuration management</li>
  <li>Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools may trigger events matching this pattern</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege: restrict the ability to perform this action to explicitly approved accounts</li>
  <li>Enable advanced auditing via Group Policy (Advanced Audit Policy Configuration) to ensure all relevant events are captured</li>
  <li>Deploy a SIEM with behavioral analytics to baseline normal activity and alert on deviations</li>
  <li>Implement privileged access management (PAM) to control and audit use of privileged credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Review all events from the same SubjectLogonId session to identify what other actions the attacker performed.</li>
  <li>Check for additional persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts in the same time window.</li>
  <li>Conduct a threat hunt across similar hosts in the same network segment for the same indicators.</li>
  <li>Engage the incident response team to scope the full extent of the compromise before returning systems to production.</li>
</ul>
