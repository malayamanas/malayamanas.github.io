<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary gains the first foothold into the target environment by exploiting T1566.001. Windows Security Event 4688 (A new process has been created) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker achieves initial access to the target environment through social engineering, exploitation, or use of stolen credentials.</li>
  <li>Using the foothold, the attacker performs initial access, execution activity related to Office Application Spawns Shell — Macro/OLE Phishing, targeting the relevant Windows subsystem or service.</li>
  <li>The attack leverages MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique T1566.001 to achieve the objective, using tools and techniques common to this attack category.</li>
  <li>Windows Security Event(s) 4688 are generated, capturing critical details of the activity including the actor identity, target object, and operation performed.</li>
  <li>Post-attack, the attacker may perform additional lateral movement, persistence, or data collection based on the access gained.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CobaltStrike (commercial C2 framework)</li>
  <li>Metasploit Framework (open-source exploitation)</li>
  <li>Impacket (Python network protocol library)</li>
  <li>CrackMapExec (post-exploitation framework)</li>
  <li>PowerSploit / PowerView (PowerShell attack modules)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>4688</strong> (A new process has been created)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NewProcessName</strong></td><td>Binaries in %TEMP%, %APPDATA%, or staging directories; renamed system tools; unsigned executables</td><td>Full path of the new process; non-standard locations and known LOLBins are high-confidence IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CommandLine</strong></td><td>Base64-encoded commands (-EncodedCommand), LOLBin invocations (certutil -decode, mshta http://), C2 URIs, or obfuscated strings</td><td>Full command line reveals the attacker&#x27;s intent; encoded or obfuscated arguments are critical IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ParentProcessName</strong></td><td>Unusual parent-child relationships: Office apps spawning PowerShell, browsers launching cmd.exe, IIS (w3wp) spawning shells</td><td>Abnormal parent processes indicate exploitation, macro execution, or code injection as the initial vector</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>TokenElevationType</strong></td><td>Full elevation token (%%1937/Type 2) from processes not normally requiring elevation; elevation outside approved admin workflows</td><td>Indicates whether a full administrative token was granted; unexplained elevation is a UAC-bypass indicator</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessId</strong></td><td>Correlate with process creation events (4688/Sysmon 1) to identify the binary, parent, and command line</td><td>Links the event to the specific process for deeper investigation and parent-child chain analysis</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 4688 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 4688
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
AND CommandLine CONTAINS (&quot;-EncodedCommand&quot; OR &quot;mshta&quot; OR &quot;rundll32&quot; OR &quot;\\AppData\\&quot;)
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 4688 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 4688 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 4688 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate administrative activity during change management windows may generate similar events</li>
  <li>Automated enterprise management platforms (SCCM, Ansible, Puppet) perform similar operations as part of configuration management</li>
  <li>Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools may trigger events matching this pattern</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege: restrict the ability to perform this action to explicitly approved accounts</li>
  <li>Enable advanced auditing via Group Policy (Advanced Audit Policy Configuration) to ensure all relevant events are captured</li>
  <li>Deploy a SIEM with behavioral analytics to baseline normal activity and alert on deviations</li>
  <li>Implement privileged access management (PAM) to control and audit use of privileged credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Review all events from the same SubjectLogonId session to identify what other actions the attacker performed.</li>
  <li>Check for additional persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts in the same time window.</li>
  <li>Conduct a threat hunt across similar hosts in the same network segment for the same indicators.</li>
  <li>Engage the incident response team to scope the full extent of the compromise before returning systems to production.</li>
</ul>
