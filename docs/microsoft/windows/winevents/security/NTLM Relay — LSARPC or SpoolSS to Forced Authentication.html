<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary targets credentials or authentication material to enable further compromise by exploiting T1557.001. Windows Security Event 5145 (A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker positions themselves to intercept NTLM authentication attempts (via Responder, LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, or PetitPotam coercion).</li>
  <li>NTLM challenge-response is captured and forwarded (relayed) to a target service without cracking the hash.</li>
  <li>Target service authenticates the relayed request, granting the attacker access as the victim&#x27;s identity.</li>
  <li>Event 4624 on the relay target shows a network logon with NTLM authentication from the relay host, not the victim&#x27;s actual workstation.</li>
  <li>Combined with ESC8 (ADCS relay) or SMB signing disabled, NTLM relay can achieve domain compromise.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Responder (LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS poisoning)</li>
  <li>ntlmrelayx.py (Impacket)</li>
  <li>CrackMapExec --relay</li>
  <li>MultiRelay</li>
  <li>PetitPotam (NTLM coercion via EfsRpcOpenFileRaw)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ShareName</strong></td><td>ADMIN$, C$, IPC$ access from non-administrative accounts or external IP addresses</td><td>Administrative shares accessed remotely indicate lateral movement preparation or ransomware deployment</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>RelativeTargetName</strong></td><td>Sensitive file names (ntds.dit, SAM, SECURITY, *.kdbx, *.pfx, id_rsa) accessed via network shares</td><td>The specific file accessed within the share; sensitive file names confirm data theft intent</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>IpAddress</strong></td><td>Non-RFC1918 addresses, Tor exit nodes, cloud infrastructure IPs, or addresses not in the corporate IP inventory</td><td>Reveals the source of the connection; external or untrusted source IPs immediately elevate severity</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>LogonType</strong></td><td>Type 3 (network) from unexpected accounts; Type 10 (remote interactive) from non-admin accounts; Type 5 (service) from interactive users</td><td>Classifies how authentication occurred; type anomalies for the account class reveal misuse or attack patterns</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AuthenticationPackageName</strong></td><td>NTLM in Kerberos-only environments (indicates downgrade attack); unexpected packages like MSV1_0 for service accounts</td><td>Authentication protocol used; protocol downgrade or unexpected packages reveal relay attacks or legacy exploitation</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>TargetUserName</strong></td><td>Privileged accounts (Administrator, KRBTGT, Domain Admin names, service accounts) are high-value targets</td><td>Identifies which account is under attack or being acted upon; privilege level determines impact</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 5145 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 5145
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
AND IpAddress NOT IN &lt;trusted_ip_ranges&gt;
AND LogonType IN (3, 10)
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 5145 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 5145 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 5145 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate after-hours work by on-call staff, developers, or global teams in different time zones</li>
  <li>Service accounts performing scheduled maintenance tasks outside business hours</li>
  <li>Automated monitoring and backup systems generating logon events at any hour</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Implement privileged access workstations (PAW) to restrict administrative logons to dedicated secure hosts</li>
  <li>Enforce MFA for all remote and VPN logons to prevent credential-only attacks</li>
  <li>Configure Conditional Access policies to block high-risk logons based on impossible travel or unfamiliar devices</li>
  <li>Deploy LAPS to prevent lateral movement using shared local administrator credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Reset passwords for all accounts confirmed or suspected to be compromised; prioritise privileged accounts.</li>
  <li>If KRBTGT hash was exposed (DCSync), perform two sequential KRBTGT password resets to invalidate existing golden tickets.</li>
  <li>Audit and revoke any Kerberos service tickets (TGTs/TGS) that may have been captured; force re-authentication.</li>
  <li>Review and revoke any certificates issued around the time of the attack (check AD CS audit logs).</li>
  <li>Hunt for pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket usage across the environment using Event 4624 NTLM logon correlation.</li>
</ul>
