<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary targets credentials or authentication material to enable further compromise by exploiting OS Credential Dumping. Windows Security Event 5156 (The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted a connection) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker achieves code execution with local administrator or SYSTEM privileges on the target host.</li>
  <li>Attacker opens a handle to the lsass.exe process with PROCESS_VM_READ permissions, triggering Event 4663 with ObjectName matching the LSASS process.</li>
  <li>Memory is read from the LSASS process space, extracting cached Kerberos tickets, NT hashes, and plaintext credentials from WDigest (if enabled).</li>
  <li>Dumped credentials are saved to disk or transferred in-memory using tools that avoid writing to disk.</li>
  <li>Extracted credentials enable lateral movement throughout the domain without further exploitation.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords</li>
  <li>ProcDump (native Sysinternals tool used legitimately)</li>
  <li>CobaltStrike hashdump</li>
  <li>Impacket</li>
  <li>Nanodump / SilentProcessExit</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>5156</strong> (The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted a connection)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessID</strong></td><td>Unexpected or anomalous values in this field context</td><td>Provides essential context for understanding the ProcessID involved in this event</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Application</strong></td><td>LSASS.exe, winlogon.exe, or svchost.exe making network connections; any process making connections to unexpected destinations</td><td>The process initiating the network connection; system processes should have limited, predictable network behaviour</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Direction</strong></td><td>Inbound on non-standard ports; outbound from LSASS, svchost, or winlogon to external IPs</td><td>Network connection direction; outbound from credential processes to external hosts indicates exfiltration</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SourceAddress</strong></td><td>External or unauthorized source IPs for management traffic; spoofed source addresses in internal traffic</td><td>Source IP for the connection; links network activity to a specific host for isolation and investigation</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SourcePort</strong></td><td>High-numbered ephemeral ports from persistent long-running connections may indicate C2 keepalive</td><td>Source port; unusual persistence of a specific source port over time indicates a sustained connection</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DestAddress</strong></td><td>Internal Domain Controllers, sensitive servers, or external IPs from unexpected processes (e.g., LSASS making outbound connections)</td><td>Destination IP; LSASS or system processes connecting to external IPs indicate credential exfiltration</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DestPort</strong></td><td>445 (SMB), 389/636 (LDAP), 88 (Kerberos), 3389 (RDP), 5985/5986 (WinRM) from unexpected sources; non-standard ports from system processes</td><td>Destination port reveals the intended protocol; protocol-anomaly detection (e.g., Kerberos from non-DC) is powerful</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Protocol</strong></td><td>Protocol 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP); non-standard protocols (1=ICMP, 47=GRE) from system processes may indicate tunnelling</td><td>Network protocol identifier; protocol anomalies combined with suspicious applications reveal covert channels</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>LayerRTID</strong></td><td>Specific WFP filter layer IDs reveal what enforcement point triggered the event (transport, network, stream layers)</td><td>WFP layer identifier; helps correlate with the specific firewall rule and understand what traffic was affected</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (Critical Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 5156 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 5156
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 5156 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 5156 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 5156 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate administrative activity during change management windows may generate similar events</li>
  <li>Automated enterprise management platforms (SCCM, Ansible, Puppet) perform similar operations as part of configuration management</li>
  <li>Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools may trigger events matching this pattern</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege: restrict the ability to perform this action to explicitly approved accounts</li>
  <li>Enable advanced auditing via Group Policy (Advanced Audit Policy Configuration) to ensure all relevant events are captured</li>
  <li>Deploy a SIEM with behavioral analytics to baseline normal activity and alert on deviations</li>
  <li>Implement privileged access management (PAM) to control and audit use of privileged credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Reset passwords for all accounts confirmed or suspected to be compromised; prioritise privileged accounts.</li>
  <li>If KRBTGT hash was exposed (DCSync), perform two sequential KRBTGT password resets to invalidate existing golden tickets.</li>
  <li>Audit and revoke any Kerberos service tickets (TGTs/TGS) that may have been captured; force re-authentication.</li>
  <li>Review and revoke any certificates issued around the time of the attack (check AD CS audit logs).</li>
  <li>Hunt for pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket usage across the environment using Event 4624 NTLM logon correlation.</li>
</ul>
