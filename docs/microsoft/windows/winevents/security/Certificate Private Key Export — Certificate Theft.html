<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary targets credentials or authentication material to enable further compromise by exploiting Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys. Windows Security Event 4663 (An attempt was made to access an object) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker identifies misconfigured Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) templates using Certify or Certipy.</li>
  <li>For ESC1: attacker requests a certificate using a template with enrollee-supplied SANs, specifying a privileged account (Domain Admin) as the SAN.</li>
  <li>The request is approved by the CA, issuing a certificate valid for the specified privileged identity.</li>
  <li>Attacker uses the certificate to request a Kerberos TGT (PKINIT) as the Domain Admin, bypassing password authentication.</li>
  <li>Events 4886 (certificate request received) and 4887 (certificate issued) are generated at the CA with the requester and template details.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Certify (Certificate template abuse)</li>
  <li>Certipy (AD CS attack framework)</li>
  <li>Rubeus (PKINIT certificate-based authentication)</li>
  <li>Impacket certsync</li>
  <li>SharpDPAPI</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>4663</strong> (An attempt was made to access an object)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectName</strong></td><td>Registry Run keys, IFEO paths, sensitive files (ntds.dit, SAM, LSASS), or unusual AD object DNs</td><td>Specifies exactly what object was accessed or modified; the path alone is often the strongest IOC</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectType</strong></td><td>Unexpected object types (Key for registry, File, Directory) being accessed by unusual processes</td><td>Clarifies what kind of resource is involved; sensitive types accessed by unexpected processes are IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AccessList</strong></td><td>Replication rights GUIDs (DCSync), write/delete permissions on sensitive objects, or broad access masks on sensitive files</td><td>Specifies exact permissions granted; specific right combinations like DCSync GUIDs are definitive IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessName</strong></td><td>System processes (lsass.exe, svchost.exe, winlogon.exe) performing unusual operations; user-space tools accessing protected resources</td><td>Identifies the executable performing the action; unexpected process names are a primary IOC</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>RequesterName</strong></td><td>Non-standard accounts requesting privileged certificate templates; machine accounts requesting user certificates or vice versa</td><td>The account requesting the certificate; unexpected account-template combinations reveal certificate abuse</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CertificateTemplate</strong></td><td>SubCA, SmartcardLogon, User, or Computer templates requested by unexpected accounts; ESC1/ESC8 vulnerable template names</td><td>Certificate template name; certain templates with misconfigured permissions enable full domain compromise (AD CS attacks)</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 4663 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 4663
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 4663 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 4663 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 4663 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate administrative activity during change management windows may generate similar events</li>
  <li>Automated enterprise management platforms (SCCM, Ansible, Puppet) perform similar operations as part of configuration management</li>
  <li>Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools may trigger events matching this pattern</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege: restrict the ability to perform this action to explicitly approved accounts</li>
  <li>Enable advanced auditing via Group Policy (Advanced Audit Policy Configuration) to ensure all relevant events are captured</li>
  <li>Deploy a SIEM with behavioral analytics to baseline normal activity and alert on deviations</li>
  <li>Implement privileged access management (PAM) to control and audit use of privileged credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Reset passwords for all accounts confirmed or suspected to be compromised; prioritise privileged accounts.</li>
  <li>If KRBTGT hash was exposed (DCSync), perform two sequential KRBTGT password resets to invalidate existing golden tickets.</li>
  <li>Audit and revoke any Kerberos service tickets (TGTs/TGS) that may have been captured; force re-authentication.</li>
  <li>Review and revoke any certificates issued around the time of the attack (check AD CS audit logs).</li>
  <li>Hunt for pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket usage across the environment using Event 4624 NTLM logon correlation.</li>
</ul>
