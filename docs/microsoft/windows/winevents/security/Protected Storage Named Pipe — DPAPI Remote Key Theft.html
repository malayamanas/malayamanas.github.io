<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary targets credentials or authentication material to enable further compromise by exploiting OS Credential Dumping: LSA Secrets. Windows Security Event 5145 (A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker establishes a foothold on an initial victim host within the target network.</li>
  <li>Attacker uses tools such as PsExec, Impacket SMBExec, or CobaltStrike&#x27;s <code>jump psexec</code> to connect to the IPC$ share on a remote host using stolen credentials.</li>
  <li>A named pipe connection is established over SMB to the remote host, enabling remote code execution or service control communication.</li>
  <li>The remote named pipe connection is logged as a network share access (Event 5140 IPC$) or a network logon (Event 4624 LogonType 3).</li>
  <li>The attacker executes commands, installs services, or interacts with remote processes via the named pipe transport.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Impacket smbexec.py / psexec.py</li>
  <li>CobaltStrike (psexec lateral movement)</li>
  <li>PsExec (Sysinternals)</li>
  <li>Metasploit psexec module</li>
  <li>SysInternals PsExec</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>5145</strong> (A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ShareName</strong></td><td>ADMIN$, C$, IPC$ access from non-administrative accounts or external IP addresses</td><td>Administrative shares accessed remotely indicate lateral movement preparation or ransomware deployment</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>RelativeTargetName</strong></td><td>Sensitive file names (ntds.dit, SAM, SECURITY, *.kdbx, *.pfx, id_rsa) accessed via network shares</td><td>The specific file accessed within the share; sensitive file names confirm data theft intent</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>IpAddress</strong></td><td>Non-RFC1918 addresses, Tor exit nodes, cloud infrastructure IPs, or addresses not in the corporate IP inventory</td><td>Reveals the source of the connection; external or untrusted source IPs immediately elevate severity</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AccessMask</strong></td><td>0x40 (READ_CONTROL), 0x80000 (GENERIC_READ), 0x1F01FF (full control); write/delete on sensitive objects is suspicious</td><td>Hex representation of requested permissions; high-privilege masks from unexpected processes are IOCs</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 5145 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 5145
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
AND IpAddress NOT IN &lt;trusted_ip_ranges&gt;
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 5145 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 5145 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 5145 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>File servers serving high volumes of legitimate requests will generate many 5140/5145 events</li>
  <li>Backup systems accessing administrative shares (ADMIN$, C$) for agent deployment</li>
  <li>IT automation platforms using SMB for software distribution</li>
  <li>Domain controller replication and SYSVOL access generates 5140 events from all domain-joined machines</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Disable SMBv1 across the entire environment (critical for preventing relay attacks and EternalBlue exploitation)</li>
  <li>Enable SMB signing to prevent relay attacks that don&#x27;t require cracked credentials</li>
  <li>Block direct SMB (445) at the network perimeter and between network segments where SMB is not required</li>
  <li>Apply firewall rules restricting ADMIN$ and C$ access to management VLAN IP ranges only</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Reset passwords for all accounts confirmed or suspected to be compromised; prioritise privileged accounts.</li>
  <li>If KRBTGT hash was exposed (DCSync), perform two sequential KRBTGT password resets to invalidate existing golden tickets.</li>
  <li>Audit and revoke any Kerberos service tickets (TGTs/TGS) that may have been captured; force re-authentication.</li>
  <li>Review and revoke any certificates issued around the time of the attack (check AD CS audit logs).</li>
  <li>Hunt for pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket usage across the environment using Event 4624 NTLM logon correlation.</li>
</ul>
