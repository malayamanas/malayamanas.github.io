<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker achieves initial access to the target environment through social engineering, exploitation, or use of stolen credentials.</li>
  <li>Using the foothold, the attacker performs persistence, privilege escalation, credential access activity related to Unconstrained Delegation Set on User — msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo, targeting the relevant Windows subsystem or service.</li>
  <li>The attack leverages MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique T1098 to achieve the objective, using tools and techniques common to this attack category.</li>
  <li>Windows Security Event(s) 4738, 5136 are generated, capturing critical details of the activity including the actor identity, target object, and operation performed.</li>
  <li>Post-attack, the attacker may perform additional lateral movement, persistence, or data collection based on the access gained.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CobaltStrike (commercial C2 framework)</li>
  <li>Metasploit Framework (open-source exploitation)</li>
  <li>Impacket (Python network protocol library)</li>
  <li>CrackMapExec (post-exploitation framework)</li>
  <li>PowerSploit / PowerView (PowerShell attack modules)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>4738</strong> (A user account was changed)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>TargetUserName</strong></td><td>Privileged accounts (Administrator, KRBTGT, Domain Admin names, service accounts) are high-value targets</td><td>Identifies which account is under attack or being acted upon; privilege level determines impact</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AllowedToDelegateTo</strong></td><td>Unexpected or anomalous values in this field context</td><td>Provides essential context for understanding the AllowedToDelegateTo involved in this event</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectDN</strong></td><td>Domain root DN, Schema partition, sensitive user/computer DNs being modified; OU structure manipulation</td><td>Distinguished Name of the AD object; modifications to sensitive AD objects indicate domain-level compromise</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectGUID</strong></td><td>GUID correlating to known sensitive AD objects (Domain root, schema objects, privileged groups)</td><td>Globally unique identifier; use to cross-reference with AD schema and identify the exact object being targeted</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectClass</strong></td><td>groupPolicyContainer, trustedDomain, msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount, user, computer objects being created or modified</td><td>AD object class; modifications to privileged classes indicate persistence, trust manipulation, or account creation</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AttributeLDAPDisplayName</strong></td><td>member (group membership), unicodePwd (password), userAccountControl (account flags), msDS-KeyCredentialLink (Shadow Credentials), servicePrincipalName (Kerberoasting)</td><td>The LDAP attribute being changed; sensitive attributes are primary targets for persistence and privilege escalation</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AttributeSyntaxOID</strong></td><td>Object identifiers for complex or rarely-used attribute types may indicate schema manipulation or unusual AD operations</td><td>Defines the data type of the attribute being modified; complex OIDs help identify the nature of the change</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AttributeValue</strong></td><td>New group members in privileged groups; encoded or obfuscated password values; UAC flags enabling attack vectors (e.g., DONT_REQ_PREAUTH)</td><td>The actual value written to the AD attribute; new privileged group members or suspicious flag values are direct IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DSName</strong></td><td>Unexpected domain or application partition names; cross-forest partition modifications from non-DC accounts</td><td>Identifies the directory service partition; cross-partition operations from unexpected sources indicate privilege abuse</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DSType</strong></td><td>Active Directory Domain Services vs. Lightweight Directory Services; unexpected type changes may reveal attack surface expansion</td><td>Type of directory service involved; anomalies here help distinguish domain-level from application-level AD attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OpCorrelationID</strong></td><td>Groups multiple directory service write operations; correlate with nearby 5136 events using the same ID</td><td>Correlates multiple AD operations in one atomic change; useful for reconstructing complex multi-step AD modifications</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AppCorrelationID</strong></td><td>Application-level correlation ID; Mimikatz and Impacket generate distinctive patterns visible here</td><td>Application-level tracking identifier; tool-specific patterns can fingerprint the attacker&#x27;s toolkit</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 4738 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 4738
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 4738 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 4738 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 4738 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate administrative activity during change management windows may generate similar events</li>
  <li>Automated enterprise management platforms (SCCM, Ansible, Puppet) perform similar operations as part of configuration management</li>
  <li>Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools may trigger events matching this pattern</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege: restrict the ability to perform this action to explicitly approved accounts</li>
  <li>Enable advanced auditing via Group Policy (Advanced Audit Policy Configuration) to ensure all relevant events are captured</li>
  <li>Deploy a SIEM with behavioral analytics to baseline normal activity and alert on deviations</li>
  <li>Implement privileged access management (PAM) to control and audit use of privileged credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Reset passwords for all accounts confirmed or suspected to be compromised; prioritise privileged accounts.</li>
  <li>If KRBTGT hash was exposed (DCSync), perform two sequential KRBTGT password resets to invalidate existing golden tickets.</li>
  <li>Audit and revoke any Kerberos service tickets (TGTs/TGS) that may have been captured; force re-authentication.</li>
  <li>Review and revoke any certificates issued around the time of the attack (check AD CS audit logs).</li>
  <li>Hunt for pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket usage across the environment using Event 4624 NTLM logon correlation.</li>
</ul>
