<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary establishes a persistent foothold that survives reboots and credential resets by exploiting Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features. Windows Security Event 4657 (A registry value was modified) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker achieves initial access to the target environment through social engineering, exploitation, or use of stolen credentials.</li>
  <li>Using the foothold, the attacker performs persistence, privilege escalation activity related to Sticky Keys / Accessibility Tool Replaced — Backdoor Logon, targeting the relevant Windows subsystem or service.</li>
  <li>The attack leverages MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique T1546.008 to achieve the objective, using tools and techniques common to this attack category.</li>
  <li>Windows Security Event(s) 4657 are generated, capturing critical details of the activity including the actor identity, target object, and operation performed.</li>
  <li>Post-attack, the attacker may perform additional lateral movement, persistence, or data collection based on the access gained.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CobaltStrike (commercial C2 framework)</li>
  <li>Metasploit Framework (open-source exploitation)</li>
  <li>Impacket (Python network protocol library)</li>
  <li>CrackMapExec (post-exploitation framework)</li>
  <li>PowerSploit / PowerView (PowerShell attack modules)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>4657</strong> (A registry value was modified)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectName</strong></td><td>Registry Run keys, IFEO paths, sensitive files (ntds.dit, SAM, LSASS), or unusual AD object DNs</td><td>Specifies exactly what object was accessed or modified; the path alone is often the strongest IOC</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectValueName</strong></td><td>Registry value names used by known malware persistence (Run, RunOnce, AppInit_DLLs, Debugger)</td><td>Identifies the specific registry value; malware-known value names are high-confidence IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OldValue</strong></td><td>Previous value before modification; preserves evidence of what was overwritten for forensic comparison</td><td>Shows the original configuration; significant changes to security-relevant settings are critical</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NewValue</strong></td><td>New registry value content; encoded commands (base64, -EncodedCommand), LOLBin paths (mshta, rundll32, wscript), or UNC paths</td><td>The value written by the attacker; contains the actual payload path or encoded malicious command</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessId</strong></td><td>Correlate with process creation events (4688/Sysmon 1) to identify the binary, parent, and command line</td><td>Links the event to the specific process for deeper investigation and parent-child chain analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessName</strong></td><td>System processes (lsass.exe, svchost.exe, winlogon.exe) performing unusual operations; user-space tools accessing protected resources</td><td>Identifies the executable performing the action; unexpected process names are a primary IOC</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 4657 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 4657
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
AND (NewValue CONTAINS &quot;powershell&quot; OR TaskContent CONTAINS &quot;-EncodedCommand&quot;)
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 4657 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 4657 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 4657 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate after-hours work by on-call staff, developers, or global teams in different time zones</li>
  <li>Service accounts performing scheduled maintenance tasks outside business hours</li>
  <li>Automated monitoring and backup systems generating logon events at any hour</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Implement privileged access workstations (PAW) to restrict administrative logons to dedicated secure hosts</li>
  <li>Enforce MFA for all remote and VPN logons to prevent credential-only attacks</li>
  <li>Configure Conditional Access policies to block high-risk logons based on impossible travel or unfamiliar devices</li>
  <li>Deploy LAPS to prevent lateral movement using shared local administrator credentials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Identify and remove the persistence mechanism (registry key, scheduled task, service, or DLL) from all affected hosts.</li>
  <li>Search for the same persistence IOC (file hash, registry key value, task content) across all endpoints in the environment.</li>
  <li>Review the affected account&#x27;s full activity history for the past 30 days to understand the scope of the compromise.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the affected host from a known-good image if deep persistence (bootkit, firmware, or multiple mechanisms) is suspected.</li>
</ul>
