<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary bypasses, disables, or subverts security monitoring and controls by exploiting T1222. Windows Security Event 4670 (Permissions on an object were changed) provides the primary detection signal when properly audited and monitored in a SIEM.

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker achieves broad network access through lateral movement, often using compromised domain admin credentials.</li>
  <li>Ransomware binary is distributed via GPO, scheduled task, PsExec, or direct copy to network shares.</li>
  <li>The ransomware enumerates and accesses files on local drives and mapped network shares, triggering Event 4663 for each file access.</li>
  <li>Files are encrypted in-place or after copying; VSS snapshots are deleted (vssadmin delete shadows) to prevent recovery — Event 4688 captures vssadmin execution.</li>
  <li>Event 5140/5145 logs mass share access; Event 7036 shows backup and AV services being stopped prior to encryption.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>LockBit, BlackCat/ALPHV, Cl0p, Royal, Akira ransomware families</li>
  <li>Conti / BlackBasta (affiliate-deployed)</li>
  <li>Custom ransomware deployed post-compromise</li>
  <li>Ryuk (Emotet → TrickBot → Ryuk chain)</li>
  <li>REVil/Sodinokibi</li>
</ul>

<strong>Primary Detection Event:</strong> Security Event ID <strong>4670</strong> (Permissions on an object were changed)

<strong>Critical fields to monitor / correlate (Required attributes):</strong>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Typical malicious / suspicious value(s) / pattern</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserSid</strong></td><td>Non-SYSTEM SID from an interactive user or service account not normally performing this action</td><td>Uniquely identifies the security principal; unexpected SIDs performing sensitive operations are high-priority IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectUserName</strong></td><td>Unexpected user accounts, machine accounts in human context, or recently created/renamed accounts</td><td>Human-readable identity of the actor; enables cross-event correlation and user-behaviour analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectDomainName</strong></td><td>Workgroup name, external/untrusted domain, or NT AUTHORITY when privileged account is expected</td><td>Confirms account origin; cross-domain or workgroup operations in AD environments indicate lateral movement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SubjectLogonId</strong></td><td>Correlate with Event 4624 to reveal logon type (3=network, 10=remote interactive), source IP, and workstation</td><td>Links this event to a specific authenticated session; essential for timeline and pivot-path reconstruction</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectServer</strong></td><td>DS (Directory Service) for AD object access; Security Account Manager for SAM database operations</td><td>Windows subsystem handling the request; DS combined with replication rights confirms DCSync activity</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectType</strong></td><td>Unexpected object types (Key for registry, File, Directory) being accessed by unusual processes</td><td>Clarifies what kind of resource is involved; sensitive types accessed by unexpected processes are IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ObjectName</strong></td><td>Registry Run keys, IFEO paths, sensitive files (ntds.dit, SAM, LSASS), or unusual AD object DNs</td><td>Specifies exactly what object was accessed or modified; the path alone is often the strongest IOC</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OldSd</strong></td><td>Unexpected or anomalous values in this field context</td><td>Provides essential context for understanding the OldSd involved in this event</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NewSd</strong></td><td>Unexpected or anomalous values in this field context</td><td>Provides essential context for understanding the NewSd involved in this event</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessId</strong></td><td>Correlate with process creation events (4688/Sysmon 1) to identify the binary, parent, and command line</td><td>Links the event to the specific process for deeper investigation and parent-child chain analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ProcessName</strong></td><td>System processes (lsass.exe, svchost.exe, winlogon.exe) performing unusual operations; user-space tools accessing protected resources</td><td>Identifies the executable performing the action; unexpected process names are a primary IOC</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (Medium Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Event ID 4670 matching the highest-fidelity field combination shown above</li>
  <li>Apply thresholds appropriate to the environment: a single event may be sufficient for critical-level detections; volume thresholds apply for medium/low</li>
  <li>Correlate with Event 4624 (successful logon) using SubjectLogonId to establish the session context and identify the source IP and workstation</li>
</ul>

<strong>Highest-Fidelity Correlation (SIEM Query Logic):</strong>
<pre><code>EventID = 4670
AND SubjectUserName NOT IN &lt;approved_admin_accounts&gt;
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Correlate 4670 events where SubjectLogonId links to a Type 3 (network) or Type 10 (remote interactive) logon from an external IP address</li>
  <li>Alert on 4670 events from accounts in privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins) outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Hunt for 4670 events followed within 60 seconds by lateral movement indicators (5140, 4624 to other hosts) from the same SubjectLogonId</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate disk encryption tools (BitLocker, VeraCrypt, enterprise DLP encryption) generate similar file access patterns</li>
  <li>Large-scale data migration or backup operations may create bursts of file creation/modification events</li>
  <li>Anti-virus scan engines performing deep reads of files create access events without modification</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Implement immutable offline or air-gapped backups following the 3-2-1-1-0 backup rule</li>
  <li>Deploy application allowlisting to prevent unknown executables from running on endpoints and servers</li>
  <li>Enable Controlled Folder Access (Windows Defender) on all endpoints to block unauthorized file modification</li>
  <li>Segment networks to prevent ransomware from reaching backup infrastructure and file servers simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (SubjectUserName/SubjectLogonId) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve all relevant Windows Security Event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation.</li>
  <li>Correlate the triggering event with Event 4624 logon records to identify the source IP, workstation, and session that performed the action.</li>
  <li>Immediately disconnect all affected hosts from network shares and backup systems to prevent ransomware spread.</li>
  <li>Identify the ransomware strain and check for available decryptors (nomoreransom.org, vendor resources).</li>
  <li>Restore from the most recent clean backup after confirming the restore environment is isolated and clean.</li>
  <li>Engage legal, compliance, and communications teams as ransomware incidents typically trigger regulatory notification requirements.</li>
  <li>Conduct post-incident root cause analysis to identify and close the initial access vector before restoration.</li>
</ul>
