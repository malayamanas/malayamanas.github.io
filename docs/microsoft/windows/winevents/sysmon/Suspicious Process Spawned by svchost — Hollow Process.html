<strong>Short Description</strong>
An adversary bypasses, disables, or subverts security monitoring and controls through Suspicious Process Spawned by svchost — Hollow Process. Sysmon Event(s) 1, 8, 25 (Process Creation, CreateRemoteThread, ProcessTampering) provide the primary Sysmon-layer detection signal for this technique.

<p><ul>
  <li><strong>Tactic</strong>     : Defense Evasion  </li>
</ul><br>
  <strong>Technique</strong> : T1055.012 (T1055.012)</p>

<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker has code execution and targets a legitimate host process to inject into for stealth or memory-resident execution.</li>
  <li>Sysmon Event 10 (ProcessAccess) fires when the attacker&#x27;s process opens a handle to the target process — GrantedAccess 0x001F0FFF or 0x0020 (VM_WRITE) indicate injection intent.</li>
  <li>Sysmon Event 8 (CreateRemoteThread) fires when a new thread is injected into the target process — StartModule=NULL indicates shellcode (no DLL on disk).</li>
  <li>For process hollowing, Sysmon Event 25 (ProcessTampering) fires when Sysmon detects the in-memory image differs from the on-disk binary.</li>
  <li>Sysmon Event 3 from the now-compromised target process reveals C2 connections that appear to originate from the legitimate process.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Cobalt Strike (reflective DLL injection, process injection modules)</li>
  <li>Meterpreter (migrate command for process injection)</li>
  <li>Custom shellcode loaders</li>
  <li>Process hollowing frameworks (Donut, Gargoyle)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-key-sysmon-event-indicators">4. Key Sysmon Event Indicators</h3>

<h4 id="sysmon-event-1-process-creation">Sysmon Event 1 — Process Creation</h4>

<p>A new process was created. Captures image path, command line, parent, hashes, user, and integrity level.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Suspicious Value / Pattern</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Image</strong></td><td>Non-system path (%TEMP%, %AppData%, %ProgramData%), renamed system binaries, known tool names (mimikatz.exe, rubeus.exe, psexec.exe, cobalt*)</td><td>Full path of the spawned executable; non-standard paths and known attacker tools are primary IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CommandLine</strong></td><td>Encoded commands (-EncodedCommand, -enc), LOLBin abuse flags (certutil -decode, mshta http://), credential access arguments (sekurlsa, lsadump, pth)</td><td>Full command line reveals exact attacker intent; encoded or obfuscated arguments are critical IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ParentImage</strong></td><td>Office apps (winword.exe, excel.exe) spawning PowerShell/cmd; browsers spawning cmd; svchost.exe spawning unexpected children; w3wp.exe (IIS) spawning shells</td><td>Abnormal parent-child relationships reveal the initial execution vector (macro, exploit, injection)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ParentCommandLine</strong></td><td>Encoded PowerShell from Office; mshta.exe launching script; wscript.exe executing remote content</td><td>Parent&#x27;s full command clarifies the delivery mechanism and payload stage</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OriginalFileName</strong></td><td>Mismatch between Image filename and OriginalFileName field (e.g., Image=svchost.exe but OriginalFileName=mimikatz.exe)</td><td>Catches renamed attacker tools that attempt to masquerade as legitimate Windows binaries</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Hashes</strong></td><td>Known malware hashes (cross-reference threat intelligence feeds); unsigned binaries with high-entropy names</td><td>Hash-based detection is immune to filename changes; enables instant enrichment with threat intelligence</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>IntegrityLevel</strong></td><td>High or System from a process spawned by a low-privilege parent; elevation without UAC prompt context</td><td>Indicates whether the process ran with elevated privileges; unexpected elevation reveals bypass techniques</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>User</strong></td><td>SYSTEM-context processes from interactive user sessions; service accounts launching interactive processes</td><td>Process owner; unexpected user context for a given image path indicates impersonation or privilege escalation</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="sysmon-event-8-createremotethread">Sysmon Event 8 — CreateRemoteThread</h4>

<p>A thread was created in another process. Primary indicator of process injection and shellcode injection.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Suspicious Value / Pattern</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>TargetImage</strong></td><td>lsass.exe (credential theft), explorer.exe (process hollowing C2), svchost.exe (service-based injection), browsers (credential/session theft)</td><td>Process being injected into; high-value target processes are chosen for stealth and access to sensitive memory</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SourceImage</strong></td><td>Unexpected source: powershell.exe, cmd.exe, Office applications, wscript.exe injecting into system processes</td><td>Process performing the injection; non-standard source processes performing CreateRemoteThread reveal the attacker&#x27;s loader</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>StartModule</strong></td><td>NULL (shellcode, no module name) or a module in %TEMP%/%AppData%; known injection staging DLLs</td><td>Module containing the injected thread entry point; NULL StartModule is a classic shellcode injection indicator</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>StartFunction</strong></td><td>LoadLibraryA/W with a malicious DLL argument (reflective loading); CreateThread shellcode stubs</td><td>Entry point of the injected thread; LoadLibrary calls with suspicious argument paths reveal DLL injection</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="sysmon-event-25-processtampering">Sysmon Event 25 — ProcessTampering</h4>

<p>A process image was tampered (process hollowing, doppelgänging). Detected by Sysmon comparing on-disk vs in-memory image.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Suspicious Value / Pattern</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Image</strong></td><td>System processes (svchost.exe, explorer.exe, taskhost.exe) that have been hollowed; any process where Sysmon detects a mismatch between the on-disk binary and the in-memory image</td><td>Process whose image was tampered; system process names are deliberately chosen to evade detection — this event catches the hollowing despite the legitimate-looking name</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>ProcessHollowing (SuspendResumeInjection), ProcessDoppelgänging (transactional NTFS injection), Herpaderping (file-on-disk replaced after mapping)</td><td>Specific tampering technique detected; different types have different forensic artefacts and require different response procedures</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (High Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Sysmon event(s) 1, 8, 25 matching the field combinations shown in Section 4</li>
  <li>Apply environment-specific thresholds: a single matching event may be sufficient for critical-level detections</li>
</ul>

<strong>Sigma Detection Rule (YAML skeleton):</strong>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">title: Suspicious Process Spawned by svchost — Hollow Process

</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Hunt for <code>Sysmon 1 / Sysmon 8 / Sysmon 25</code> events where Image is NOT in the approved software baseline</li>
  <li>Alert on Sysmon 1 / Sysmon 8 / Sysmon 25 from accounts in privileged groups outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Correlate Sysmon 1 events with subsequent Windows Security 4624/4625 events to link process activity to authentication events</li>
  <li>Stack-rank <code>Sysmon 1 / Sysmon 8 / Sysmon 25</code> events by Image path to identify rare/novel executables across the fleet</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate administrative operations by IT staff may generate similar Sysmon events</li>
  <li>Authorized enterprise management platforms performing identical operations</li>
  <li>Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools in approved assessment windows</li>
  <li>Development and testing environments running attack simulation frameworks</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apply Principle of Least Privilege: restrict the ability to perform this attack to the minimum required accounts</li>
  <li>Deploy comprehensive Sysmon configuration (SwiftOnSecurity or Florian Roth config) to capture all relevant events</li>
  <li>Configure SIEM correlation rules to baseline normal Sysmon patterns and alert on deviations</li>
  <li>Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or equivalent EDR for behavioral detection in addition to Sysmon event-based detection</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (from Sysmon Event 1 User field or Windows Security 4624 correlation) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve Sysmon event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation — export the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational channel.</li>
  <li>Correlate the Sysmon events with Windows Security logs using the LogonId field to link process activity to authenticated sessions.</li>
  <li>Perform memory analysis of the affected system to identify all injected code, hollowed processes, and loaded kernel modules.</li>
  <li>Search for the same driver hash or injected DLL hash across all endpoints using EDR retrospective hunt.</li>
  <li>If a vulnerable driver was loaded (BYOVD), check all systems for the vulnerable driver and remove/block it via WDAC policy.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the affected system — kernel-level compromise cannot be reliably remediated without full OS reinstall.</li>
