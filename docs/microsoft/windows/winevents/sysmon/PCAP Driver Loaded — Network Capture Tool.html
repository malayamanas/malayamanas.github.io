<h3 id="3-how-the-attack-typically-works-procedure">3. How the Attack Typically Works (Procedure)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker requires a kernel-mode capability: EDR bypass, privilege escalation (BYOVD), network capture, or system-level access.</li>
  <li>Sysmon Event 6 (DriverLoaded) fires when the driver is loaded — this is the primary detection event, capturing the driver path, hashes, and signing status.</li>
  <li>For BYOVD attacks, a known-vulnerable but signed driver is loaded, then exploited to disable security controls or escalate privileges.</li>
  <li>Sysmon Event 1 captures the loader process that drops and loads the driver; Event 11 captures the driver file being written to disk.</li>
  <li>For network capture drivers (npcap, WinPcap), Sysmon Event 6 fires with the capture driver image path — correlate with the capturing application process.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Most common tools observed in 2024–2026:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Known vulnerable drivers (RTCore64.sys, WinRing0x64.sys, gdrv.sys for BYOVD)</li>
  <li>npcap / WinPcap (network capture)</li>
  <li>Custom kernel drivers for EDR killing</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sysmon-event-1-process-creation">Sysmon Event 1 — Process Creation</h4>

<p>A new process was created. Captures image path, command line, parent, hashes, user, and integrity level.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Suspicious Value / Pattern</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Image</strong></td><td>Non-system path (%TEMP%, %AppData%, %ProgramData%), renamed system binaries, known tool names (mimikatz.exe, rubeus.exe, psexec.exe, cobalt*)</td><td>Full path of the spawned executable; non-standard paths and known attacker tools are primary IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CommandLine</strong></td><td>Encoded commands (-EncodedCommand, -enc), LOLBin abuse flags (certutil -decode, mshta http://), credential access arguments (sekurlsa, lsadump, pth)</td><td>Full command line reveals exact attacker intent; encoded or obfuscated arguments are critical IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ParentImage</strong></td><td>Office apps (winword.exe, excel.exe) spawning PowerShell/cmd; browsers spawning cmd; svchost.exe spawning unexpected children; w3wp.exe (IIS) spawning shells</td><td>Abnormal parent-child relationships reveal the initial execution vector (macro, exploit, injection)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ParentCommandLine</strong></td><td>Encoded PowerShell from Office; mshta.exe launching script; wscript.exe executing remote content</td><td>Parent&#x27;s full command clarifies the delivery mechanism and payload stage</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OriginalFileName</strong></td><td>Mismatch between Image filename and OriginalFileName field (e.g., Image=svchost.exe but OriginalFileName=mimikatz.exe)</td><td>Catches renamed attacker tools that attempt to masquerade as legitimate Windows binaries</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Hashes</strong></td><td>Known malware hashes (cross-reference threat intelligence feeds); unsigned binaries with high-entropy names</td><td>Hash-based detection is immune to filename changes; enables instant enrichment with threat intelligence</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>IntegrityLevel</strong></td><td>High or System from a process spawned by a low-privilege parent; elevation without UAC prompt context</td><td>Indicates whether the process ran with elevated privileges; unexpected elevation reveals bypass techniques</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>User</strong></td><td>SYSTEM-context processes from interactive user sessions; service accounts launching interactive processes</td><td>Process owner; unexpected user context for a given image path indicates impersonation or privilege escalation</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="sysmon-event-6-driver-loaded">Sysmon Event 6 — Driver Loaded</h4>

<p>A kernel-mode driver was loaded. Captures image path, hash, and signing status.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Suspicious Value / Pattern</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>ImageLoaded</strong></td><td>Driver paths outside %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\; drivers in %TEMP%, user-writable directories, or with random names; known vulnerable driver names (RTCore64.sys, PROCEXP152.sys)</td><td>Full path of the loaded driver; drivers outside standard system paths or matching known-vulnerable names are critical IOCs</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Signed</strong></td><td>False — unsigned driver loading requires disabling Secure Boot or exploiting driver signing bypass</td><td>Signing status; unsigned drivers in modern environments indicate Secure Boot bypass or BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attack</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Signature</strong></td><td>Revoked certificates; certificates belonging to companies whose signing keys were leaked; self-signed certificates</td><td>Signing entity; revoked or suspicious certificates on drivers indicate attacker infrastructure or compromised vendor keys</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SignatureStatus</strong></td><td>Expired, Revoked, or HashMismatch — all indicate the driver was tampered with after signing</td><td>Signature validation result; any non-Valid status for a system driver is a critical indicator of tampering or BYOVD</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Hashes</strong></td><td>Hashes matching known vulnerable or malicious drivers in threat intelligence feeds (e.g., LOLDrivers project)</td><td>Driver hash; cross-reference with LOLDrivers database to identify vulnerable drivers used for privilege escalation or EDR killing</td></tr>

<h3 id="5-detection-hunting-recommendations">5. Detection / Hunting Recommendations</h3>

<strong>Strong / Classic Signature Rule (Medium Confidence)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Alert on Sysmon event(s) 1, 6 matching the field combinations shown in Section 4</li>
  <li>Apply environment-specific thresholds: a single matching event may be sufficient for critical-level detections</li>
</ul>

<strong>Sigma Detection Rule (YAML skeleton):</strong>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">title: PCAP Driver Loaded — Network Capture Tool
status: experimental
logsource:
    category: process_creation  # adjust per primary Sysmon event type
    product: windows

    ParentImage|endswith|any:  # Suspicious parent
      - &#x27;\\winword.exe&#x27;
      - &#x27;\\excel.exe&#x27;
      - &#x27;\\powerpnt.exe&#x27;
      - &#x27;\\w3wp.exe&#x27;

    condition: selection
level: medium
tags:
    - execution
    - collection
    - t1040
</code></pre>

<strong>Contextual / Behavioral Hunting Queries (SIEM / EDR)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Hunt for <code>Sysmon 1 / Sysmon 6</code> events where Image is NOT in the approved software baseline</li>
  <li>Alert on Sysmon 1 / Sysmon 6 from accounts in privileged groups outside approved maintenance windows</li>
  <li>Correlate Sysmon 1 events with subsequent Windows Security 4624/4625 events to link process activity to authentication events</li>
  <li>Stack-rank <code>Sysmon 1 / Sysmon 6</code> events by Image path to identify rare/novel executables across the fleet</li>
</ul>

<strong>False Positive Considerations</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Legitimate network monitoring tools (Wireshark/npcap, Microsoft Network Monitor) load capture drivers</li>
  <li>VPN clients load network filter drivers on installation</li>
  <li>AV/EDR solutions load kernel-mode filter drivers for real-time protection</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended Hardening (Prevention &amp; Impact Reduction)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Enable Secure Boot and enforce UEFI firmware integrity to prevent unsigned driver loading</li>
  <li>Enable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) — never disable for production systems</li>
  <li>Use HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) to enforce kernel code signing</li>
  <li>Maintain an allowlist of approved drivers and alert on any driver not on the list</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-recommended-response-actions">6. Recommended Response Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate the affected host from the network immediately if active exploitation or lateral movement is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Identify the initiating account (from Sysmon Event 1 User field or Windows Security 4624 correlation) and disable it pending investigation.</li>
  <li>Preserve Sysmon event logs from the affected host(s) before any remediation — export the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational channel.</li>
  <li>Correlate the Sysmon events with Windows Security logs using the LogonId field to link process activity to authenticated sessions.</li>
  <li>Perform memory analysis of the affected system to identify all injected code, hollowed processes, and loaded kernel modules.</li>
  <li>Search for the same driver hash or injected DLL hash across all endpoints using EDR retrospective hunt.</li>
  <li>If a vulnerable driver was loaded (BYOVD), check all systems for the vulnerable driver and remove/block it via WDAC policy.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the affected system — kernel-level compromise cannot be reliably remediated without full OS reinstall.</li>
</ul>
